## Reversi (Othello) game

This project is a reversi game implementation. Currently it includes AI engine (employs Negamax and Alpha-Beta pruning)  and 
basic user interface for human-ai games. \
TODO:
* optimize and clean up AI engine code
* add reversi-specific evaluation heuristics to the engine
* extend UI so that different game modes (human-human, human-ai, ai-ai) can be played, add game tree viewer and display current 
state assesment

### Motivation
Basically, this is university homework for AI course, however I've always been interested in reversi game, since it has both 
simple mechanics and interesting gameplay
